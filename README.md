# Plane Crashes Heat Map by Country - D3 Globe Visualization
## https://csc316-project.github.io/crash_map_viz/

A dynamic, interactive heat map visualization of historical plane crashes displayed by country on a 3D globe using D3.js.


### Run the Visualization Locally

** Using Python HTTP Server **

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```


**Note**: You cannot simply open `index.html` directly in the browser due to CORS restrictions when loading CSV files. You must use a local server.
